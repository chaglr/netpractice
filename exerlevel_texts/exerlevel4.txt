There are 2 computers (host B: Another host, host A: A nice host) and 1 router (router R: My_Gate) connected to a switch (switch S: Switch-1). The goals in question are as follows:
Goal 1: Host A nice host needs to communicate with host Another host.
Goal 2: Host A nice host needs to communicate with host My_Gate.
Goal 3: Host Another host needs to communicate with host My_Gate.

(s) is fixed numbers you can not change that but the oher adresses you can change it for the reaching the goals

Devices:
Host A: A nice host
Host B: Another host
Router R: My_Gate
switch S: Switch-1

connections
Interface B1 -> switch S: Switch-1
Interface A1 -> switch S: Switch-1
Interface R1 -> switch S: Switch-1

Host A: A nice host
Interface A1
	IP: 110.184.119.132(s)
	Mask: 255.255.255.240

Host B: Another host
Interface B1
	IP: 110.184.127.193
	MASK: 255.255.0.0

Router R: My_Gate
Interface R1:
	IP: 110.184.119.91
	MASK: /23
Interface R2:
	IP: 110.184.119.1(s)
	Mask: 255.255.255.128(s)
Interface R3:
	IP: 110.184.119.244(s)
	Mask: 255.255.255.192(s)

Connection details:
Interface A1, Interface B1, and Interface R1 are connected to the switch with cables.

Based on this information, let's achieve the goals:

Goal 1: To enable communication between host A nice host and host Another host, you need to assign IP addresses and subnet masks to their respective interfaces (A1 and B1) on the same subnet. For example:
- Host A (A nice host):
  - Interface A1: IP 110.184.119.132, Mask (you need to specify a valid subnet mask)
- Host B (Another host):
  - Interface B1: IP (an IP address in the same subnet as A1), Mask (the same subnet mask as A nice host)

Goal 2: To enable communication between host A nice host and host My_Gate, you need to configure the IP address and subnet mask on Interface R1 of the router to be on the same subnet as host A. For example:
- Router R (My_Gate):
  - Interface R1: IP (an IP address in the same subnet as A1), Mask (the same subnet mask as A nice host)

Goal 3: To enable communication between host Another host and host My_Gate, you need to configure the IP address and subnet mask on Interface R1 of the router to be on the same subnet as host B. For example:
- Router R (My_Gate):
  - Interface R1: IP (an IP address in the same subnet as B1), Mask (the same subnet mask as Another host)

Make sure the IP addresses and subnet masks are properly configured to fulfill these goals, and ensure that the switch and cable connections are operational.
