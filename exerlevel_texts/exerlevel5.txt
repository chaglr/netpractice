Level 5:
Goal 1: Host Machine A needs to communicate with host The Mighty Router.
Goal 2: Host Machine B needs to communicate with host The Mighty Router.
Goal 3: Host Machine A needs to communicate with host Machine B.

There are 2 hosts (host B: Machine B, host A: Machine A) and 1 router (router R: The Mighty Router).
These hosts are connected to the router via cables. Host B (Interface B1) is connected to the router's Interface R2, and host A (Interface A1) is connected to the router's Interface R1.

(s) is fixed numbers you can not change that but the oher adresses you can change it for the reaching the goals

Here is the required information:

Host A: Machine A
Routes: 10..0.0.0/8 => 192.168.0.254
Interface A1:
	IP: 104.198.14.2
	Mask: 255.255.255.0

Host B: Machine B
Routes: default(s) -> 192.168.0.254
Interface B1:
	IP: 192.168.42.42
	MASK: /30

Router R: The Mighty Router
Interface R2:
	IP: 153.49.132.254(s)
	Mask: 255.255.192.0(s)
Interface R1
	IP: 30.187.9.126(s)
	Mask: 255.255.255.128(s)

To achieve the goals:

Goal 1: To enable communication between host Machine A and host The Mighty Router, you need to configure Interface A1 on host A and Interface R1 on the router with compatible IP addresses and subnet masks. For example:
- Host A (Machine A):
  - Interface A1: IP (an IP address on the same subnet as R1), Mask (the same subnet mask as R1)
- Router R (The Mighty Router):
  - Interface R1: IP 30.187.9.126, Mask 255.255.255.128

Goal 2: To enable communication between host Machine B and host The Mighty Router, you need to configure Interface B1 on host B and Interface R2 on the router with compatible IP addresses and subnet masks. For example:
- Host B (Machine B):
  - Interface B1: IP (an IP address on the same subnet as R2), Mask (the same subnet mask as R2)
- Router R (The Mighty Router):
  - Interface R2: IP 153.49.132.254, Mask 255.255.192.0

Goal 3: To enable communication between host Machine A and host Machine B, both hosts should be configured with IP addresses on the same subnet. Choose appropriate IP addresses and subnet masks for both host A (Machine A) and host B (Machine B) to achieve this goal.
