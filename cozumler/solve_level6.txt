The internet behaves like a router. However,
 if an interface is connected directly or indirectly to the internet, it cannot have an IP address in the following reserved private IP ranges:

192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (65,536 IP addresses)
172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255   (1,048,576 IP addresses)
10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255     (16,777,216 IP addresses)

1. The next hop of the internet is already entered, and matches the IP address of the Interface R2.
Therefore we only need to bother with the destination of the internet.

The internet must send its packets to Client A. To do so, the internet's destination must match the network address of Client A.
Let's find the network address of Client A:

Client A's mask is 255.255.255.128, which is equivalent to /25.
This means that the first 25 bits of its IP address are its network address.
We know then that the first 3 bytes (24 bits) of its IP address make part of its network address:




bunu cozumu soyle oluyor. oncelikle R1 ile A1 ayni subnet koymalyiz. veri alisverisi olsun.
1)sabit olan R1 mask A1 e kopyala
2)sonra tum paketleri R1 e yollamasi icin  icin A1 route dest default yap next hop ise R1 in ip adresi yap.
3)router R paketleri internete gondermesi icin default gateway olarak 0.0.0.0/0 olmali.
4) internet route a1 paket gondermesi icin destination i A1 in network adresi olmali


network adresi nasil bulunur.
ip adresinin 255 mask kismini ip olarak aynen yaz. kalan kisimini bit olarak yaz. geri kalan kismini 0 yazinca network adresi buluruz. 1 yazindada
broadcast adresi max
